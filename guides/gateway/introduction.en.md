# Gateway Mode

Mercado Pago offers you the possibility of operating with your own merchant numbers. This processing mode is called Gateway.

## Considerations

* To be able to use this processing mode in the production mode:
	* You must be registered with the respective acquirers of your country.
	* You need to contact your account manager.
	* If you already have a FirstData merchant number you have to get its terminals and share them with your account executive.
	
* Nevertheless, you will be able to freely use the [_Sandbox_](/guides/payments/api/testing.en.md) mode to test the product operation and advance your integration.
